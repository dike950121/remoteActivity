# Cybersecurity Graduation Project: Remote Access Payload

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a stealthy remote access payload targeting Windows systems. The project consists of two main components:

- **C++ Client:** A lightweight, stealthy payload running on Windows machines, providing remote access features such as command execution, file transfer, and screen sharing.
- **C# Server:** A server application to manage and control multiple client devices, facilitating command and control communication.

## Key Features and Requirements

### C++ Client
- Silent operation with no visible UI or command windows.
- No dependency on .NET or other external libraries at runtime.
- Persistence through user login without appearing in startup programs.
- Encryption and obfuscation to protect source code and prevent reverse engineering.
- Network propagation capabilities including lateral movement and Active Directory targeting.
- Anti-deletion mechanisms and kernel-level storage for protection.
- Scalability to control up to 100,000 devices.

### C# Server
- Manages and controls multiple client devices.
- Implements secure command and control protocols.
- Provides interfaces for file transfer, command execution, and screen sharing.
- Designed for scalability and efficient client management.

## Development Plan

### C++ Client Development
- Implement core payload with stealth and persistence.
- Develop remote access features incrementally.
- Integrate encryption and obfuscation layers.
- Implement network propagation and anti-detection mechanisms.

### C# Server Development
- Develop server application for client management.
- Implement secure communication protocols.
- Provide user interfaces for remote access features.
- Ensure scalability and security.

## Testing Strategy
- Critical-path testing focusing on stealth, persistence, and remote access functionality.
- Optional thorough testing covering security evasion, network propagation, and scalability.
- Compatibility testing across various Windows versions.
