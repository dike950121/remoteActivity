## 📋 Project Overview

Remote Activity is a sophisticated cybersecurity graduation project that implements an advanced remote access system with stealth capabilities. The project consists of a client-side spy bot and a server-side management interface designed for educational research in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and ethical hacking studies.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:

### 1. Client-Side SPY BOT (C++)
- **Language**: C++
- **Target Platform**: Windows
- **Deployment**: Kernel-level storage
- **Dependencies**: Self-contained (no external libraries)

### 2. Server-Side Management Interface (WPF .NET)
- **Framework**: WPF .NET
- **Purpose**: Multi-bot management and control
- **Scalability**: Supports up to 100,000+ devices

## 🔧 Core Features

### Client-Side Capabilities
- **Stealth Operation**: Hidden execution with no visible processes
- **Persistence**: Kernel-level storage prevents manual removal
- **Self-Update**: Automatic update mechanism via server
- **Event Monitoring**: Comprehensive system activity tracking
  - Keyboard events
  - File transfer operations
  - Copy/paste activities
  - Executable file execution
  - Browser activity (URLs, cookies)
- **Command Execution**: Remote command processing
- **Screen Control**: Remote desktop capabilities
- **File Management**: Remote file system access
- **Network Propagation**: Lateral movement capabilities
- **Active Directory Targeting**: Enterprise network integration

### Server-Side Capabilities
- **Multi-Device Management**: Control thousands of devices simultaneously
- **Centralized Control**: Unified interface for all connected bots
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live activity feeds from all devices
- **Command Distribution**: Broadcast commands to multiple devices
- **Update Management**: Centralized bot update distribution
- **Data Collection**: Aggregated event logs and system information

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Anti-Detection Mechanisms
- **Code Obfuscation**: Base64 and hex encoding
- **Reverse Engineering Protection**: Encrypted source code
- **AV Bypass**: Advanced evasion techniques
- **Process Hiding**: Invisible execution
- **Kernel Persistence**: Deep system integration

### Communication Security
- **DDNS Integration**: Dynamic server discovery
- **Resilient Connectivity**: Automatic reconnection on failure
- **Encrypted Communication**: Secure data transmission
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: User activity confirmation
