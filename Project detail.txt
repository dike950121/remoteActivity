I'm working on a cybersecurity graduation project, which involves creating a payload for remote access. The task includes developing a Windows-targeted payload with specific remote access features such as file transfer, command execution, and screen sharing.

The ideal freelancer for this project should have:
- Extensive knowledge and experience in cybersecurity
- Proficiency in C# and C++
- Skills in developing Windows-targeted software
- Understanding of remote access capabilities

Please contact me privately for more details.
